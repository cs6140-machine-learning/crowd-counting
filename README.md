Hello, This is the final project of CS6140, Machine Learning Courses from Northeastern University.
Team members are: Jihao Zhang, Zeyang Wang
The main purpose is to train a model to predict crowd quantity in one picture.
The training datasets are from Kaggle website and due to the size limit, they are not
complete in this repo, please use the following shell command to get them:
